// This gets loaded after bootstrap/variables is loaded and before bootstrap is loaded.
// A good hello-hello-example.ts of this is when you want to override a bootstrap variable to be based
// on the default value of bootstrap. This is pretty specialized case. Thus, you normally
// just override bootrap variables in preBootstrapCustomizations so that derived
// variables will use your definition.
//
// For hello-hello-example.ts, in _variables.scss:
// $input-height: (($font-size-base * $line-height) + ($input-padding-y * 2) + ($border-width * 2)) !default;
// This means that you could define this yourself in preBootstrapCustomizations. Or you can do
// this in bootstrapCustomizations to make the input height 10% bigger than the default calculation.
// Thus you can leverage the default calculations.
// $input-height: $input-height * 1.10;


// here you can customize fonts and so on... check the bootstrap-loader's documentation
