// Customize Bootstrap variables that get imported before the original Bootstrap variables.
// Thus original Bootstrap variables can depend on values from here. All the bootstrap
// variables are configured with !default, and thus, if you define the variable here, then
// that value is used, rather than the default. However, many bootstrap variables are derived
// from other bootstrap variables, and thus, you want to set this up before we load the
// official bootstrap versions.
// For hello-hello-example.ts, _variables.scss contains:
// $input-color: $gray !default;
// This means you can define $input-color before we load _variables.scss

// at the beginning to support Bootstrap 4 beta 1
