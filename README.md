# My M.E.A.N. website client/front-end (Alpha)

<br>

**This is the client side.** Server side is available [HERE](https://github.com/Ks89/My-MEAN-website-server)

<br>

## Informations
My MEAN website is a MEAN's web application that I'm creating as a personal website, but also for other users.
It's composed by:
- M: a MongoDb's database
- E: a back-end with Express js
- A: a front-end in Angular 2
- N: a back-end in Node.js
- redis
- webpack and gulp
- and other stuff

A possible extension of this project will be a configurable template to build a custom web app very quickly. This is my final goal, please be patient :)

Attention! This project is still an alpha, so it's not production ready. Please be careful.
If you are interested, star this project on GitHub, share it and create pull requests.

Testing:
- front-end unit: coverage >80%
- front-end e2e: work in progress, In future alphas I'll complete everything

## Requirements
- macOS, Linux or Windows 10 **with admin privileges**
- Node.js + npm
- some global npm dependencies
- [My-MEAN-website server](https://github.com/Ks89/My-MEAN-website-server) Alpha4 or greater
- Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox (mandatory if you want to run `npm test`) (also Internet Explorer if you are using Windows)
- work in progress... (this is only an alpha, please be patient)

## How to install (MacOS)
- install both [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
- from the `setup` folder of this project, run `bash install-macos.sh`
- import the db dump (.json) from `docs`'s folder using MongoChef or another software

## How to install (Linux)
- install both [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
- from the `setup` folder of this project, run `bash install-linux.sh`
- import the db dump (.json) from `docs`'s folder using MongoChef or another software

## How to install (Windows 10)
*Tested only on Windows 10*

- install both [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
- install Node.js from the [official website](https://www.nodejs.org)
- install MongoDb Community from the [official website](https://www.mongodb.com)
- import the db dump (.json) from `docs`'s folder using MongoChef or another software [HERE](http://3t.io/mongochef/download/)
- install redis-server for Windows (file .msi) [HERE](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releases)
- install Python 2.7.x from the [official website](https://www.python.org)
- from the `setup` folder of this project, run with PowerShell as administator `bash install-windows.sh`

If you'll have problems with `node-zopfli`, you have to install it properly following [this tutorial](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation). There are two options, try with the first one `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools`, if it will fail, use option 2.
Both options will require to download really big files from microsoft.com (manually or automatically). So, be careful.

## How to setup
1. if necessary rename (case-sensitive) the main folder of this project into `My-MEAN-website-client` to match `FRONT_END_PATH` in `.env` file of [server-side](https://github.com/Ks89/My-MEAN-website-server)
2. put the main folder of this project near `My-MEAN-website-server` (in the future I'll give you a way to configure this)
3. execute `npm install` into the root folder (if it will fail, run it again)
4. follow [the tutorial](https://github.com/Ks89/My-MEAN-website-server) to prepare [My-MEAN-website server](https://github.com/Ks89/My-MEAN-website-server)  (remember to start both MongoDb and redis-server)
5. start [My-MEAN-website server](https://github.com/Ks89/My-MEAN-website-server)  with `npm start`
6. execute `npm start` into the root folder to start this application (client/front-end)

This will start this application at http://localhost:3300

PS: If you didn't start server-side before, you won't be able to see the entire home page (because created using data taken from DB)

## How to run unit tests (with karma)
- `npm test`

## How to run e2e tests (with protractor)
- `npm run e2e`

## How to start (development mode with HMR and BrowserSync)
1. cd `My-MEAN-website-server`
2. `npm start`
3. cd ..
4. cd `My-MEAN-website-client` (if necessary rename it (case-sensitive) to match `FRONT_END_PATH` in `.env` file of [server-side](https://github.com/Ks89/My-MEAN-website-server))
5. `npm start` (or `npm run build` for production)
6. Surf to **http://localhost:3300**

If you want to start the admin page, go to **http://localhost:3300/admin.html**
Attention: it's very unstable, because I decided to implement only some basic features. I'll improve it in the next alphas.

## How to start (development mode bundle)
1. cd `My-MEAN-website-server`
2. `npm start`
3. cd ..
4. cd `My-MEAN-website-client` (if necessary rename it (case-sensitive) to match `FRONT_END_PATH` in `.env` file of [server-side](https://github.com/Ks89/My-MEAN-website-server))
5. `npm run buildDev`
6. Surf to **http://localhost:3000**

If you want to start the admin page, go to **http://localhost:3000/admin.html**
Attention: it's very unstable, because I decided to implement only some basic features. I'll improve it in the next alphas.

## How to start (production mode bundle)
1. cd `My-MEAN-website-server`
2. `npm start`
3. cd ..
4. cd `My-MEAN-website-client` (if necessary rename it (case-sensitive) to match `FRONT_END_PATH` in `.env` file of [server-side](https://github.com/Ks89/My-MEAN-website-server))
5. `npm run build`
6. Surf to **http://localhost:3000** (if [My-MEAN-website server](https://github.com/Ks89/My-MEAN-website-server) is in dev mode, otherwise the correct port will be `3000`)

If you want to start the admin page, go to **http://localhost:3000/admin.html**
Attention: it's very unstable, because I decided to implement only some basic features. I'll improve it in the next alphas.
